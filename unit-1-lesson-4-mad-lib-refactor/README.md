## Questions
- Inside "smooth-transition" folder
    - ng-if seems to collide with $scope.generateMadLib.$valid
    - $scope.generateMadLib appears to be undefined
    - I think ng-if creates a child scope, how do you use a form inside an ng-if?

- How do I implement the following inside the "animation" folder?
    - on click, the shown element slides down and fades out
    - once fully faded, the new element appears from the bottom up
